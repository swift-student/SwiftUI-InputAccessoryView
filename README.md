# SwiftUI-InputAccessoryView

This is an example project I made showcasing how to implement an input accessory view by wrapping a UITextField in SwiftUI. It allows you to advance betweeen text fields and dismiss with a done button as shown in the screenshot below:

I created this project only a couple months after learning swift, so I'm sure there are improvements that can be made with better understanding of SwiftUI. That said, if you fork and add any contributions, please feel free to create a PR!
